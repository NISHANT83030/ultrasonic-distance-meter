## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. The microcontroller sends a 10¬µs pulse to the Trig pin.
2. The HC-SR04 emits an ultrasonic burst.
3. Echo pin goes HIGH and stays HIGH until echo is received.
4. The duration of the HIGH signal is used to calculate distance.
5. Distance is displayed on the LCD. If it‚Äôs below a threshold, the buzzer alerts.

**Distance formula:**

```text
Distance (cm) = (Time √ó Speed of Sound) / 2
Speed of sound = 343 m/s
